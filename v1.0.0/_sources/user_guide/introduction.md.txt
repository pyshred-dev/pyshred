# Introduction to PySHRED

## What is PySHRED?

PySHRED is a Python package implementing the SHallow REcurrent Decoder (SHRED) architecture for sensing applications. PySHRED achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on full-state reconstructions and forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics from very few sensors.

The three core components of PySHRED are the sequence, decoder, and latent forecaster models.

- **Sequence model:** a neural architecture that learns the temporal dependencies in sensor measurements and projects them into a low-dimensional latent representation.
- **Decoder model:** a neural architecture that learns a mapping between the low-dimensional latent representation and the high-dimensional state space.
- **Latent forecaster model:** a model that takes in the current latent states and predicts the future latent states.

The sequence and decoder models work together to reconstruct the high-dimensional state space from sensor measurements. The latent forecaster and decoder models work together to forecast high-dimensional state space dynamics without needing additional sensor measurements.

PySHRED achieves amazing performance on most applications straight out-of-the-box. If you want to build your own SHRED model optimized for your application, PySHRED allows you to seamlessly mix-and-match different built-in sequence, decoder, and latent forecaster models. Furthermore, you can customize the architecture of each specific sequence/decoder/latent forecaster model to best fit your specific application.

**Figure:** The SHRED architecture includes a sequence model that encodes temporal sensor dynamics into a low-dimensional latent space, and a decoder that reconstructs the full-state space from that latent representation. Additionally, SHRED includes a latent forecaster model to predict the future evolution of the latent space, which is decoded to reconstruct the future full-state spatiotemporal dynamics.

## When to use PySHRED?

PySHRED is a powerful tool for any application involving the reconstruction/forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics from timeseries sensors measurements.

- **Reconstruction** is a sensing task involving the inference of full-state system dynamics from sensor measurements.

- **Forecasting** is a sensing task involving the inference of future full-state system dynamics without using additional sensor measurements.

**Note:** PySHRED is a supervised learning model, and requires access to full-state data during training.
