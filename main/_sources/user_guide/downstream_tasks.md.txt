# Downstream Tasks

Once you have trained a SHRED model, you can use it for various downstream sensing and prediction tasks. The `SHREDEngine` object provides a convenient interface that wraps your trained SHRED model and DataManager, making it easy to:

- encode sensor measurements to latent space
- forecast future latent space states
- decode latent space back to full-state space
- evaluate full-state reconstructions from sensor measurements against the ground-truth

## Initialize SHREDEngine

To initialize SHREDEngine, pass in a `DataManager` and a trained `SHRED` model.

```python
from pyshred import SHREDEngine

# Assuming you have a trained SHRED model and DataManager
engine = SHREDEngine(data_manager, trained_shred_model)
```

## Encode sensor measurements to latent space

The `SHREDEngine` object provides a `.sensor_to_latent()` method for generating the latent space associated with the raw sensor measurements.
The raw sensor measurements should have shape (time_steps, num_sensors) and the column order of sensors should match the `.sensor_measurements_df` attribute in `DataManager`.

```python
# Raw sensor measurements (e.g., from physical sensors)
sensor_data = your_sensor_measurements  # Shape: (time_steps, num_sensors)

# Convert to latent space
latent_representation = engine.sensor_to_latent(sensor_data)
```

**Figure:** The `sensor_to_latent` method takes in raw sensor measurements, scales it, generates lagged sequences of the scaled sensor measurements, then passes it through SHRED's `sequence_model` to obtain the latent space associated with the raw sensor measurements.

Note: the lagged sequences near the start are padded by zeros because there is not enough sensor measurements to look back on.
```

## Forecast future latent space states

The `SHREDEngine` provides a `.forecast_latent()` method that predicts future latent states starting from an initial sequence of latent vectors. This method is available if `SHRED`'s `.latent_forecaster` is not `None`.

```python
# Generate latent states from current sensor measurements
current_latents = engine.sensor_to_latent(sensor_measurements)

# Set forecast horizon (number of steps to predict into the future)
forecast_horizon = 50

# Prepare initial seed for forecasting
seed_length = shred.latent_forecaster.seed_length
init_latents = current_latents[-seed_length:]

# Forecast future latent states
forecasted_latents = engine.forecast_latent(h=forecast_horizon, init_latents=init_latents)
```

```{figure} /_static/forecast_latent_figure.png
:alt: Latent Space Forecasting Pipeline
:name: fig:latent-forecasting-pipeline
:width: 100%

**Figure:** The `forecast_latent` method takes in a forecast horizon (number of steps to forecast into the future) and an initial latent space seed. The timesteps requried for the seed depends on SHRED's `latent_forecaster` model selected. `SINDy_forecaster` requires only a single latent space timestep. `LSTM_forecaster` requires the latent space seed to be of length lags (lags set in `LSTM_forecaster`). The seed is passed into the SHRED's `latent_forecaster`, which then forecasts the latent space `h` timesteps into the future.
```

## Decode Latent Space Back to Full-State Space

The `SHREDEngine` provides a `.decode()` method for converting latent representations back into the full-state space.

```python
# Convert latent representations back to full state
full_state_reconstruction = engine.decode(latent_representation)

# You can also decode forecasted latent states
forecasted_full_state = engine.decode(forecasted_latent)
```

```{figure} /_static/decoder_figure.png
:alt: Latent Space to Full-State Space Pipeline
:name: fig:latent-to-full-state-pipeline
:width: 100%

**Figure:** The `decoder` method takes in a latent space, passes it through SHRED's `decoder_model`, and returns the full-state reconstruction of the latent space.
```

## Evaluate reconstructions from sensor measurements against ground truth

The `SHREDEngine` provides an `.evaluate()` method that compares reconstructed full-state outputs (from sensor measurements) against the unprocessed ground truth. This method performs end-to-end evaluation in the physical space, automatically handling all necessary post-processing steps.

### What the evaluation includes:

- **Unscaling**: Converts normalized predictions back to original scales using fitted scalers
- **Decompression**: Projects back to full-state space if SVD compression was used during preprocessing
- **Dataset unstacking**: Separates multiple datasets if more than one was added to the DataManager
- **Metric computation**: Calculates comprehensive error metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ²)

### Usage example:

```python
# Prepare ground truth data as a dictionary mapping dataset IDs to arrays
# Each array should have shape (time_steps, *spatial_dimensions)
ground_truth = {
    "dataset_1": full_state_data_1,  # shape: (T, height, width) for 2D spatial data
    "dataset_2": full_state_data_2   # shape: (T, nx, ny, nz) for 3D spatial data
}

# Evaluate model performance
evaluation_results = engine.evaluate(
    sensor_measurements=test_sensor_data,  # shape: (T, n_sensors)
    Y=ground_truth
)

# Display results
print(evaluation_results)
#           MSE      RMSE       MAE        R2
# dataset
# dataset_1  0.123    0.351     0.245     0.892
# dataset_2  0.098    0.313     0.198     0.913
```
